# This is the story of PolyCalculator

### PolyCalculator is a Discord bot that was developed by [@jd#0001](https://discord.com/channels/@me/217385992837922819) to help the community a game called The Battle of Polytopia (+15M downloads). The game has math-heavy mechanics making it hard to predict the outcome of fights.

### The community of now (April 2022) over 34k members was relying on a [website](https://frothfrenzy.github.io/polytopiacalculator) making the experience heavy-handed by needing apps (the game itself, the calc website and discord).

### jd solved this by learning NodeJS and building a Discord bot that takes in the input of player as text in Discord and spitting out the outcome(s) of the fight.

### Now having been grated the Verified tag on Discord, the bot boasts of over 310k uses and has used optimization to calculate the best outcome for a fight!
